Methods and Enumerations

1.Create a class definition named Operations. All the methods in Operations class should be
defined static. Test the methods you write in main method of OperationsTest class.

2.Write a method isMultiple that determines, for a pair of integers, whether the second integer is
a multiple of the first. The method should take two integer arguments and return true if the
second is a multiple of the first and false otherwise.

3.Write the static Hypotenuse method of Operations class which takes two side lengths as
parameter(double), calculates and returns hypotenuse value(double typed) of a right triangle.

4.Write a method squareOfAsterisks that displays a solid square (the same number of rows and
columns) of asterisks whose side is specified in integer parameter side. For example, if side is 4,
the method should display
****
****
****
****
Incorporate this method into an application that reads an integer value for side from the user
and outputs the asterisks with the squareOfAsterisks method

5.(Reversing Digits) Write a method that takes an integer value and returns the number with its
digits reversed. For example, given the number 7631, the method should return 1367.
Incorporate the method into an application that reads a value from the user and displays the
result.

6.(Coin Tossing) Write an application that simulates coin tossing. Let the program toss a coin each
time the user chooses the “Toss Coin” menu option. Count the number of times each side of the
coin appears. Display the results. The program should call a separate method flip that takes no
arguments and returns a value from a Coin enum (HEADS and TAILS). [Note: If the program
realistically simulates coin tossing, each side of the coin should appear approximately half the
time.]
